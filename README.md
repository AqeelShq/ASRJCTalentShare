WA2 WEBAPP PROJECT

# Inspiration
The main inspiration was from my personal experience, where I found it difficult to showcase my own talents due to not having a big enough social media account, or people around me not having the same interests. I also have always been curious to see what other people are secretly talented in. Hence, I created this website so that students like me are able to share about their talents to others, anonymously if they want to. 

# What it does
In this webapp, its main purpose is that you are able to post photos along with a desciption about your talents in multiple categories: arts, sports, music and writing. However, you can also like the posts, or as I have named it in my webapp "Endorse".

# How it's built
This was made with flask, python, html and css

# Challenges encountered
There were many challenges in the making of this webapp. Firstly was the code for the css styling as there was a certain way I wanted it to feel, and it required me to research quite a bit on how it could be done, though relatively compared to the other challenges this was simple. The main challenge was wrapping my head around the logic for the python code, such as the endorsing or liking system for each post, or the use of multiple html pages for the different categories as before this we had only be using like one or two html pages in class, in this one I used eight. I would say the hardest challenge was the uploading system as I had to search up about os which I had never learned before. 

# Accomplishments that i'm proud of
Its not the best but im proud that I was able to make it sort of represent the vision for it I had before I made it

# What I learned
I learned more about css, files, python, and the difficulty of creating a webapp overall
